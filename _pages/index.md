Welcome! I'm Zoe, a researcher with strong interest in Human-Computer Interaction, Technology Acceptance, and Data Science/Computational Social Science.
If you want to call me Zhiqiu, the pronunciation is like <a href="https://www.howtopronounce.com/jucho" target="_blank"><span title="Pronounce" style="font-size:15px; text-decoration: none;">&#128266;</span></a>.
<br>
<br>
I am a postdoc researcher at <a href="https://cispa.de/" target="_blank">CISPA</a>. My work focuses on connecting people with transformative technologies like AI, exploring the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent systems. I believe that this dynamic interaction not only demands innovative solutions to enhance human lives but also calls for deep reflection on society and ourselves. 

Two important aspects that I want to further investigate in my research: One is about developing ethical and human-centric AI; Another is about leveraging AI tools, such as large language models, to enhance decision-making and address real-world challenges. 
My goal is to understand how people interact with technology — exploring their perceptions, preferences, and behaviors — while creating systems that respond to these needs and expectations, and having broader impact across various sectors and stakeholders.

I am passionate about exploring the interdisciplinary connections between technology, people, and society. My work spans a variety of projects, including conversational AI for social good, human-computer interaction, technology acceptance and user experience, big data analytics for transportation analytics, data-driven travel behavior analysis, and natural language processing for smart city management.

[CommunityBots: Creating and Evaluating A Multi-Agent Chatbot Platform for Public Input Elicitation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3579469){:target="_blank"}

Our recent work was accepted to CSCW 2023. We designed, developed, and evaluated CommunityBots — a multi-agent chatbot platform where each chatbot handles a different domain individually to elicit public input. To manage conversation across multiple topics and chatbots, we proposed a novel Conversation and Topic Management (CTM) mechanism that handles topic-switching and chatbot-switching based on user responses and intentions. Our evaluation demonstrates that CommunityBots participants were significantly more engaged, provided higher-quality responses, and experienced fewer conversational interruptions while conversing with multiple chatbots in the same session.

I am a human-centric AI researcher passionate about understanding the evolving relationship between humans and technology. My work sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Science, with a focus on responsible AI, user-centered design, and the dynamics of human-AI interaction.

I was a postdoc fellow in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [UMass Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I was awarded the [Postdoctoral Fellowship in Data Science](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/research/cds-postdoctoral-fellowship-program){:target="_blank"}. During my time there, I was affiliated with [Center for Data Science](https://ds.cs.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [HCI-VIS Lab](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hci-vis/){:target="_blank"}.
Afterwards, I continued my research at human-AI interaction at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, where I explored themes of AI ethics, trust, vulnerability, and ambiguity in human-AI interactions.
Examples of my projects included "Self-Disclosure to AI: The Paradox of Trust and Vulnerability in Human-Machine Interactions" and "Ambiguity in AI: The Paradox of Gender Neutrality."

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, where I was honored as a <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/presidential-fellows" target="_blank">Presidential Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://datascience.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">School of Data Science</a> and a <a href="https://praxis.scholarslab.org/about/" target="_blank">Praxis Fellow</a> with the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/digital-humanities-fellows/" target="_blank">Scholars' Lab in Digital Humanities</a>.

<em>Dissertation: Examining Travel To Non-Work Destinations: Integrating Geosocial Media And Smartphone-Based GPS Traces</em>
<br>
My dissertation focused on mining large-scale data, including geosocial media such as Yelp reviews and GPS traces, to explore human perception of the transportation environment and travel behavior within smart city frameworks. By leveraging big data as a repository for public opinions and behavioral patterns, this study extracted useful knowledge to reveal urban dynamics through a data-driven approach.
This research not only demonstrates the potential of big data in analyzing human perception and behavior but also sheds light on the early stages of the evolving human-technology relationship. People increasingly engage with technology to share opinions, preferences, and location-based data, highlighting a symbiotic relationship where human actions are both influenced by and contribute to technological systems. 
In the context of smart transportation, these data open new opportunities for understanding both social and behavioral trends at scale.
